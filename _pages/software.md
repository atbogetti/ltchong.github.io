We develop and maintain the Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), which is an open-source, highly scalable framework for carrying out extended-timescale simulations of rare events with rigorous kinetics. 



We have also developed open-source software for the following:

[Configuring plots based on data from both MD simulation and NMR spectroscopy](https://github.com/KarlTDebiec "Ramaplot and MolDynPlot")

[Testing the compatibility of color schemes with various types of color blindness](https://github.com/ajd98/misc_simulation_tools "Misc Simulation Tools")

[A Python library for kernel density estimation in n-dimensional space, including support for weighted samples](https://github.com/ajd98/kde "KDE")
